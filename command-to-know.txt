Reconnaissance and Information Gathering:
Are crucial initial phases in the field of ethical hacking and cybersecurity. They involve collecting as much information as possible about a target system, network, or organization before attempting to find vulnerabilities or carry out an attack.
Reconnaissance: This is the first phase of a hacking attack cycle, often referred to as the preparation phase. The hacker or security professional tries to gather as much information as possible about the target. Reconnaissance can be:

Passive Reconnaissance: Involves collecting information without directly interacting with the target. This could include gathering data from public sources like websites, social media, and public records.

Active Reconnaissance: Involves directly interacting with the target system to gather information. This could include using tools to scan network and system ports, detect services running on the system, and find vulnerabilities.

Information Gathering: This step is often considered part of reconnaissance but focuses specifically on the acquisition of data. It involves identifying valuable data sources and collecting information such as :
Network Information:[ IP addresses, domain details, network services, and topology].
IP addresses# 
    --$ arp -a
    --$ ping website.com 
    --$ nslookup website.com
    --$ whois website.com
    --$ whatweb website.com -a[1, 2, 4] -v --no-errors --log-verbose=path to file[filename]
Email Addresses:
    --$ theHarvester -d website.com -b all -v
    -- google => hunter.io
System Information: [Operating system details, system architecture, installed software and patches].
Organizational Information: [Employee details, office locations, internal structure, and security policies].
Technical Information: [Databases, web servers, and application frameworks].

    --$ netstat -nr [will return ip address of router]
    --$ nmap -sS -f -f -D RND [number of random ip (this option hides the hacker ip )]website.com[network exploration tool and security / port scanner]
