Legal Implications
Illegal hacking activities are subject to serious legal consequences, including fines and imprisonment. Various laws,
like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act in the United States, address hacking and related activities.
Hacking has a significant impact on the digital world, influencing how individuals, companies, 
and governments approach the security of their systems and data. With the increasing prevalence of digital technology in all aspects of life, 
the importance of understanding and defending against hacking has never been greater.
